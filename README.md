# Title: 3D Graphics Engine in C++

## Task:
1. To develop a basic yet functional 3D graphics engine using C++ and OpenGL.
2. The engine should be capable of rendering simple 3D objects and scenes, with basic camera controls and lighting effects.

## Development Phases:
Phase 1: Setup and Basic Rendering
Setting up the development environment.
Creating a basic window using GLFW.
Rendering simple shapes like triangles and rectangles.

Phase 2: 3D Objects and Transformation
Extending to 3D objects rendering.
Implementing transformations (translation, rotation, scaling).

Phase 3: Camera and Interaction
Developing a camera system.
Implementing basic user interaction for camera control.

Phase 4: Lighting and Shading
Introducing basic lighting models.
Implementing simple shading techniques.

Phase 5: Advanced Features and Refinement
Introducing texture mapping.
Enhancing user interaction and refining the rendering process.
Optimizing performance and code structure.

## Learning Outcomes
In-depth knowledge of 3D mathematics and graphics programming.
Advanced C++ programming skills, including memory management and performance optimization.
Understanding of OpenGL and its application in real-time graphics rendering.

## Challenges
Grasping complex mathematical concepts crucial for 3D rendering.
Managing performance and optimization in graphics programming.
Ensuring compatibility across different hardware and software configurations.

## Conclusion
Building a 3D Graphics Engine is a multi-faceted project that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application, offering a comprehensive learning experience. It's a journey through the intricacies of computer graphics, giving me a strong foundation in both the principles of 3D rendering and the nuances of C++ programming. This project can serve as a stepping stone to more advanced graphics programming, game development, and simulation projects.
